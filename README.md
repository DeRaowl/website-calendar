Overview
The goal of this project is to let people integrate their google calendar and join any events according to their schedule. The calendar integration can also help members to schedule meetings with other members of the squad. 

Goals
1)Add events to google calendar: Real dev squad holds multiple events for its members and as well as for the general public. These events are  listed on the website and one can register for these events by clicking on the link which takes you to the airmeet platform which is used to hold these virtual meetups and one can also add these events in their google calendars. Our goal is to cut down our dependence on the airmeet platform and build our own scheduling system.  

2)Schedule meetings with members: Real dev squad has a policy of not sharing their personal contact information with their team members. This sometimes acts as a hindrance to contact them for some specific tasks and hold meetings. We are not active on discord everytime and giving out your personal contact details are out of the picture. So we need a meeting scheduler which can help us to communicate effectively within the team and also help people outside the organization to contact our squad members.
